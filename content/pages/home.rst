I am a Research Software Engineer at the University of Oxford creating
free and open source software for autonomous microscopes and image
analysis.  I studied a degree in Biology and earned a PhD in
Biochemistry through `reproducible research in histone sequences and
chromatin live-cell imaging
<https://search.library.nuigalway.ie/permalink/f/3b1kce/TN_cdi_nuig_dspace_oai_aran_library_nuigalway_ie_10379_6841>`__.

I am involved in multiple free and open source software projects.
Besides the Python `Microscope <https://python-microscope.org>`__ and
`Cockpit <https://www.micron.ox.ac.uk/software/cockpit>`__ packages,
I'm a developer of the `GNU Octave <https://octave.org>`__ programming
language, the Octave-Forge `Image package
<https://octave.sourceforge.io/image/>`__, and was the leader of the
`Octave-Forge <https://octave.sourceforge.io/>`__ project between 2011
and 2017.  I am a maintainer of `BioPerl <https://bioperl.org/>`__ and
`Debian packages
<https://udd.debian.org/dmd/?email1=carandraug%2Bdev%40gmail.com>`__,
