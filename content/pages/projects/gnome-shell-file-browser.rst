Gnome shell
###########

Before Gnome 3, I was a big fan of `Gnome Do
<http://do.cooperteam.net/>`__.  When Gnome 3 came out, it did a lot
of the stuff .

Searching for files is a waste.

I keep my files organized and more often than not, I know exactly
where they are.  Typing the whole path is a pain.  Tab complete is
perfect but I'm not always at the command line.  I would prefer
avoiding starting the file browser.

I would like to get the file from Gnome Shell but that searches for
the file.  That is a waste of cycles, I already know where the file
is.  Would also require indexing my system which has a lot of small
files.  Before Gnome 3, I was a big fan of Gnome Do.

1. Start the overview on Gnome Shell
2. Start typing a directory name at the root of my home directory (or
   maybe already one level down)
3. Instead of opening the file browser, navigate the file contents
   directly from the overview.
4.  Eventually open the file straight from the overview.
