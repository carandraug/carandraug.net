Projects

I have "ideas" of things that could be or how things could be.  Most
of them are probably bad ideas, but some may be good.  I don't have
the time to pursue them, so here they go.  If you'd like to pursue any
of them, you can talk to me and ask what my thoughts are about them.

GUI for Makefiles
-----------------

A GUI for Makefiles.  The whole makefile already exists, we only need
a GUI to help scientists create them.

Virtual Filesystem for OMERO
----------------------------

A Virtual File system for OMERO.  Maybe FUSE?

Gnome Do for Gnome Shell
------------------------

gnome-shell plugin like gnome do to open file by auto-complete without
nautilus

machine learning to advise on contraceptice pill

A rewrite of Octave's pkg system and a systems like CPAN for it.

bioperl needs to be split. It's kinda ridiculous that a bioperl
install brings in installation of apache.

valerius

saphire - image analysis, like Fijim, in python, drop into an ipython command line.
Or maybe Octave (imageGO)

omero.jobs

omero-scrips-processing

Expenses compiler
