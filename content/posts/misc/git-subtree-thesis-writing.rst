Run the command:

    git subtree add --prefix=histone-catalogue/ --squash  git@github.com:af-lab/histone-catalogue.git master

Maybe squash is not necessary.
And I ammend the default merge commit message which does not give any information

Wird that it is not documented on https://git-scm.com/ version 2 (but
was on version 1).  Or at least not on theit own section, it is a
small text on the list of merge strategies.
